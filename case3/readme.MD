# Case 3 - simple e-commerce

to start the application

make sure port 6379, 5432, 8080 is free. and copy env.example into docker.env. and run this into terminal

```shell
docker compose up -d --build
```

make sure the application with this ping API

```curl
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/ping'
```

if te response is `pong`. The Server is running

## create user with email, name. and password 

```curl
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "email":"test@test.com",
    "name":"test",
    "password":"test@test.com"
}'
```

and the result will be 
```json
{
    "result": "created"
}
```

## login user with password
```plain
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "email":"test@test.com",
    "password":"test@test.com"
}'
```

is login is success, the response will send you the token, and save it into TOKEN variable for before making authenticated api calls
```json
{
    "result": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJuZ3VqaS1hdXRoIiwiZXhwIjoxNzI2MjgzNDIyLCJpYXQiOjE3MjYxOTcwMjIsImp0aSI6IjAxOTFlOTVjLTNlYzYtN2Q3Zi05ZjE1LWU2ZTYyM2JhMGExYiJ9.KIXuX8kvlauziBPWcPbQOKeDMThbLJdZ4maUoI-l5Lo"
}
```

## access the products

```curl
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/products'
```

and the response will be like this 
```json

            "stock": 28
        }
    }
]
```

## add product to cart use this api 
The process of adding product into cart is added one by one, so the experience will be smoother 
```curl
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/carts' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {{TOKEN}}' \
--data '{
    "product_id": 3
}'
```

and the result will be 
```json
{
    "result": "ok"
}
```

## check the availability of the cart and the product
```curl
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/carts' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJuZ3VqaS1hdXRoIiwiZXhwIjoxNzI2MjgzNDIyLCJpYXQiOjE3MjYxOTcwMjIsImp0aSI6IjAxOTFlOTVjLTNlYzYtN2Q3Zi05ZjE1LWU2ZTYyM2JhMGExYiJ9.KIXuX8kvlauziBPWcPbQOKeDMThbLJdZ4maUoI-l5Lo'
``` 

and the cart response is calculating with the actual stock in product
```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "quantity": 1,
            "message": "stock AVAILABLE for this product Infinix Hot 10",

            "product_price": 504545,
            "actual_stock": 17
        }
    ],
    "result": "ok"
}
``` 
there is 3 conditions for the cart quantity with the actual stock
| string  | send UserID                                          |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| NOT_AVAILABLE | the current stock is 0       |
| NOT_ENOUGH  |  the cart quantity is more than stock, the order cannot be created |
| AVAILABLE  | stock is available                          |

and the message will be like this 

```json
 "message": "stock ${STOCK_CONDITION} for this product Infinix Hot 10"
```

## check the availability of the cart and the product
```curl
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/carts' \

curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/carts/checkout' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {{TOKEN}}' \

## Ordering process

here's the ordering process

1. User add products into cart, and user processing cart after choosing desired cart.
2. User checkout the cart and hitting `/api/cart/checkout` API with sending selected `cart_ids` 
3. The server will the `cart_ids`, and The order will be created when stock is available. This process can capture a race condition when making an Order
4. So the Order will be saved with process `PROCESSING`, and the server will create a `OrderPublisher` to process orders one by one
5. So the Order will be consumed by `OrderConsumer` one by one to acquire the real stock
6. If stock is available the Order status will be changed from `PROCESSING` to `WAITING_FOR_PAYMENT` 
7. If stock is not available the Order status will be changed from `PROCESSING` to `CANCELED_BECAUSE_LIMITED_STOCK`


## Order Statuses

| name    | condition                                            | previous status | next statuses | implemented | remarks |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| PROCESSING | cart waiting to be proceed, cart will be processed by Redis PubSub | - | WAITING_PAYMENT | true             |         |
| WAITING_PAYMENT  | cart can be proceed | PROCESSING | SUCCESS, FAILED          |         true     |         |
| CANCELED_BECAUSE_LIMITED_STOCK | stock is less than cart quantity | PROCESSING | - | true            |         |
| SUCCESS  | order success   | WAITING_PAYMENT |      -        | false             | can be implemented with creating payment simulation|
| FAILED  | cancelling order | WAITING_PAYMENT |       -        |      false       | can be implemented with creating payment simulation|
